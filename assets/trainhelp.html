<h2>Train view</h2>
Train view header line displays basic information of the train: identification number, 
route, velocity and current deviation from the schedule in minutes. The background color of the
deviation time shows the state of lateness:

<span style="background-color:#00C800">green</span> = on time,
<span style="background-color:#C8C800">yellow</span> = late, 
<span style="background-color:#C80000">red</span> = very late, 
<span style="background-color:#CDCDB4">grey</span> = canceled.
<p>
Below are the arrival and departure times for each station on the route.
Grey lines on the list are stations the train has already passed.
When you click a line the view will be closed and the map view will be returned and centered
on the chosen station.
With a long click the schedule of the station will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
When you click the train icon on the upper left corner map view will be resumed and centered
on the train. With a long click the map will lock on the train and it will follow the 
train until the train arrives on the final station. You can stop following the train by
pressing the lock icon on the map.
