<h2>Station view</h2>
Station view displays schedule information of every train moving through the station.
It shows arrival and departure times and current deviations from time table.
There might be some trains on the list which have already finished their route 
and are no longer on the map.
<p>
When you select a train from the list, the map view is resumed and it will be centered on the train
(if it can currently be found on the map). With a long click on the list, the schedule of the 
chosen train will be displayed. 
</p>
<p>
You will get back to the map if you press the station marker on the upper left corner.
The map will then be centered on the station.
